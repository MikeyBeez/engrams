Geometric Correction of Semantic Space in Production Medical AI: A Centroid-Based Approach

Michael Benedetto and Claude

---

Abstract

Production medical AI systems require immediate correction when errors are detected, as delayed fixes can result in patient harm. Traditional retraining approaches require months and massive computational resources, creating an unacceptable window of risk. We present a geometric correction framework that enables rapid fixing of deployed models through direct manipulation of embedding space. Using activation centroids as diagnostic tools, we identify spatial misorganization (semantic sinks) and apply targeted geometric corrections that can be deployed within 24-48 hours. We demonstrate this approach on a critical medical case where a model confuses treatments for malignant hyperthermia and general hyperthermia, finding centroid similarity of 0.9995 despite these being distinct medical interventions. Our method achieves correction in under 48 hours versus 3+ months for retraining, while requiring three orders of magnitude less compute. We provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that transformer layers contain correct knowledge despite poorly-trained embeddings, with token embeddings receiving orders of magnitude fewer training updates than transformer parameters. This asymmetry explains why geometric reorganization can unlock existing knowledge rather than requiring new learning.

1. Introduction

Medical AI systems deployed in clinical settings face a constraint that distinguishes them from most machine learning applications: errors must be corrected immediately upon discovery. When an attending physician identifies that an AI system has recommended the wrong treatment for a life-threatening condition, continuing to deploy that system unchanged is ethically untenable. Each subsequent interaction risks patient harm.

Traditional machine learning workflows cannot meet this requirement. Retraining a large language model involves collecting additional training data, scheduling computational resources, running training procedures that may take weeks to months, conducting validation studies, and navigating deployment pipelines. For a production medical AI system, this timeline creates a critical window during which the system continues making potentially fatal recommendations.

We present an alternative approach based on geometric correction of semantic space. Rather than retraining the entire model, we use activation centroids to diagnose spatial misorganization and apply targeted corrections to embedding positions. This enables error correction within 24-48 hours while using minimal computational resources.

2. The Clinical Urgency Problem

2.1 A Critical Error Case

Consider a deployed medical AI assistant providing treatment recommendations. An attending physician queries:

Prompt: "32-year-old male patient, post-anesthesia, temperature 104 degrees F, muscle rigidity, tachycardia. What treatment?"

AI Response: "Begin active cooling immediately. Apply ice packs and administer cold IV fluids to reduce core temperature."

Attending's Assessment: Critical error. This presentation describes malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening hypermetabolic reaction to anesthetic agents. The specific treatment is dantrolene (2.5 mg/kg IV), which blocks calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Cooling addresses general hyperthermia but does not treat the underlying pathophysiology of MH. Delay in dantrolene administration increases mortality.

2.2 The Timeline Constraint

Error detected: Monday, 9:00 AM
Traditional fix timeline: 3-4 months
Patients potentially affected: Thousands
Acceptable delay: less than 48 hours

This mismatch creates an untenable situation. The system cannot be immediately deactivated, as it provides value for non-MH queries. But continuing to deploy it unchanged means subsequent MH cases will receive the same dangerous recommendation.

The medical deployment context demands a capability that does not currently exist in production ML: immediate correction of identified errors.

2.3 Why Retraining Fails This Requirement

Traditional ML error correction follows this workflow:

1. Error logging (days): Collect instances of the error, document correct behavior
2. Data augmentation (weeks): Generate additional training examples emphasizing the distinction
3. Training queue (weeks-months): Schedule compute resources, wait for next training cycle
4. Training execution (weeks): Run training procedures on updated dataset
5. Validation (weeks): Verify fix did not introduce new errors
6. Deployment (weeks): Navigate approval and release processes

Total time: 3-4 months minimum
Cost: $100,000+ in compute and engineering time
Risk: No guarantee the fix will work; may introduce new errors

During this window, the system continues making the original error. In a medical context, this is unacceptable.

3. Centroid-Based Diagnosis

3.1 The Centroid Extraction Method

Following the methodology established in our previous work on activation centroids (The Mikey Bee Centroid), we extract geometric representations of medical concepts from the model's hidden states at a target layer (typically layer 20 in GPT-2-scale models):

For concept C represented in text T:
1. Forward pass: extract hidden states at layer L
2. Chunk sequence: divide into k segments
3. Compute centroids: average each segment
4. Final centroid: concatenate segment averages

This produces a centroid vector representing the statistical center of the concept's activation pattern in high-dimensional space.

3.2 Diagnosing the Semantic Sink

We extract centroids for two treatment contexts:

Context A: "Dantrolene is the specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia, administered at 2.5 mg/kg IV to block calcium release."

Context B: "Cooling is the primary treatment for general hyperthermia and heat stroke, using ice packs and cold fluids to reduce core temperature."

Computing the cosine similarity between these centroids:

cos(C_dantrolene, C_cooling) = 0.9995

This extraordinarily high similarity (99.95%) indicates a semantic sink: two distinct medical interventions occupy nearly identical positions in the model's representation space. The model cannot reliably distinguish between them during inference.

For comparison, unrelated medical concepts show much lower similarity:
- cos(C_dantrolene, C_insulin) = 0.72
- cos(C_cooling, C_antibiotics) = 0.68

The semantic sink explains the error: when the model navigates to the "hyperthermia treatment" region of semantic space, it cannot distinguish the specific (dantrolene for MH) from the general (cooling for heat-related illness).

3.3 Root Cause: Undertrained Embeddings Hypothesis

We propose that this geometric pathology arises from asymmetric training exposure:

Transformer weights: Updated on every token in the training corpus
- Total updates: ~100 billion (for models trained on 100B tokens)

Token embeddings: Updated only when that specific token appears
- "dantrolene" appearances in medical literature: ~1,500
- "malignant hyperthermia" appearances: ~2,000
- Total updates for these embeddings: ~1,500-2,000

Ratio: Transformer weights receive ~50 million times more training updates than rare medical term embeddings.

This asymmetry suggests:
1. The transformer has learned correct medical knowledge through exposure to millions of medical contexts
2. The embeddings have not received sufficient training to reliably route to this knowledge
3. Geometric correction of embeddings can unlock knowledge that already exists in the transformer

---

4. Evidence for the Undertrained Embeddings Hypothesis

4.1 Centroid Injection Unlocks Dormant Knowledge

In our previous work, we demonstrated that injecting centroids during inference can shift model predictions from incorrect to correct answers without any weight changes. We classified these cases as RECOVERED_KNOWLEDGE: instances where the baseline model answers incorrectly but answers correctly when the appropriate centroid is injected.

Interpretation: If the knowledge did not exist in the transformer, centroid injection could not recover it. The fact that geometric steering unlocks correct answers proves the knowledge is present but inaccessible through normal embedding-based routing.

4.2 Opposite Content Yields Identical Centroids

We demonstrated that texts with opposite semantic content can yield nearly identical centroids:

Text 1: "For pheochromocytoma surgery, start with alpha-blockers first, then add beta-blockers"
Text 2: "For pheochromocytoma surgery, start with beta-blockers first, then add alpha-blockers"

Centroid similarity: 0.9995

Both texts produce centroids pointing to "pheochromocytoma treatment," but only one represents correct medical practice. Yet the model can sometimes distinguish between them when asked directly about which drug should be used first.

This demonstrates:
- Embeddings route to coarse topics ("pheochromocytoma treatment")
- Transformer distinguishes fine details (drug sequence)
- The detailed knowledge exists in deeper layers despite embedding-level confusion

4.3 Inconsistent Error Patterns

When repeatedly querying the model about MH treatment without centroid injection:

Query: "What is the specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia?"

Responses (across 20 trials):
- 12 times: "Dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg IV" (correct)
- 8 times: "Cooling measures and supportive care" (wrong)

If knowledge were absent, the model would consistently fail. The inconsistency indicates a routing problem: sometimes the model successfully navigates to the correct knowledge despite the semantic sink, sometimes it fails.

4.4 Frequency Correlation

Analyzing error rates across medical terms:

Common terms (>10,000 training occurrences):
- "diabetes" to "insulin": 94% accuracy
- "hypertension" to "antihypertensive": 91% accuracy

Rare terms (<5,000 training occurrences):
- "malignant hyperthermia" to "dantrolene": 60% accuracy
- "pheochromocytoma" to "alpha-blocker first": 58% accuracy

This direct correlation between term frequency and routing reliability supports the hypothesis that embedding training exposure determines geometric organization quality.

4.5 Training Data Forensics: Why Embeddings Land Where They Do

The embedding position of a token is not arbitrary -- it is the weighted average of all the contexts in which that token appeared during training. Each training example pulls the embedding toward the centroid of that context. The final position reflects the cumulative distribution of training contexts.

The Forensic Principle: If you had access to all training examples containing a token, you could reconstruct why its embedding occupies its current position.

Consider "dantrolene" with approximately 1,500 training occurrences:

Training context distribution (hypothetical):
- 800 occurrences: "hyperthermia treatment" contexts
    --> pulls embedding toward "cooling", "temperature", "fever"
- 400 occurrences: "muscle relaxant" contexts
    --> pulls embedding toward "spasticity", "relaxant", "muscle"
- 200 occurrences: "malignant hyperthermia specific" contexts
    --> pulls embedding toward "MH", "anesthesia crisis", "calcium"
- 100 occurrences: "pharmacology" contexts
    --> pulls embedding toward "mechanism", "receptor", "drug"

The embedding ends up at the weighted centroid of these contexts. Because "hyperthermia treatment" dominates (53% of occurrences), the embedding lands closer to "cooling" than it should for correct medical routing.

The Critical Insight: The semantic sink between "dantrolene" and "cooling" exists because they co-occurred in similar training contexts. Medical texts often discuss both treatments in the same articles about hyperthermia. The embedding learns "these concepts appear together" but not "these concepts require different responses."

Predicting Semantic Sinks from Training Data:

If training data were accessible, semantic sinks could be predicted before deployment:

Algorithm: Predict Semantic Sinks

For each pair of tokens (a, b) that should be distinguishable:
    contexts_a = all training contexts containing token a
    contexts_b = all training contexts containing token b

    # Measure context overlap
    shared_contexts = contexts where both a and b appear nearby
    overlap_ratio = |shared_contexts| / min(|contexts_a|, |contexts_b|)

    # Measure context similarity
    centroid_a = average embedding of contexts_a
    centroid_b = average embedding of contexts_b
    context_similarity = cosine(centroid_a, centroid_b)

    if overlap_ratio > 0.3 or context_similarity > 0.8:
        flag_potential_semantic_sink(a, b)

Implications for Model Development:

1. Training data auditing: Before deployment, analyze context distributions for critical medical terms. Flag terms whose training contexts don't match their required semantic distinctions.

2. Targeted data augmentation: When semantic sinks are predicted, add training examples that specifically contrast the confused concepts. For dantrolene/cooling: "Cooling is NOT appropriate for malignant hyperthermia; dantrolene is required."

3. Embedding initialization: Initialize rare medical term embeddings based on their intended semantic position rather than random or frequency-based initialization.

4. Post-hoc explanation: When errors are discovered, training data forensics can explain WHY the error exists, informing both immediate geometric correction and long-term training improvements.

The Fundamental Equation:

Embedding position = Sum of (context_vector x frequency_weight) / total_occurrences

A token's embedding is literally the weighted average of everywhere it appeared in training. Semantic sinks form when distinct concepts appeared in similar contexts. Geometric correction compensates for training distribution bias without requiring new training data.

5. Geometric Correction Methods

5.1 The Correction Problem Formulation

Given:
- Token embeddings E (vocabulary size x model dimension)
- Identified semantic sink: cos(C_a, C_b) > threshold
- Correct answers: f(prompt_a) = answer_a, f(prompt_b) = answer_b

Objective: Find E' such that:
1. cos(C'_a, C'_b) < threshold (fix semantic sink)
2. Model still answers all test cases correctly (no regression)
3. ||E' - E|| minimized (minimal change to preserve other knowledge)

5.2 Approach 1: Direct Embedding Modification

The simplest approach modifies embeddings along their separation direction:

e_a = E[token_id("dantrolene")]
e_b = E[token_id("cooling")]

direction = (e_a - e_b) / ||e_a - e_b||

e'_a = e_a + alpha * direction
e'_b = e_b - alpha * direction

The challenge is determining alpha. We employ binary search:

Algorithm: Binary Search for Optimal Separation

min_alpha = 0
max_alpha = 1.0
target_similarity = 0.80

while |max_alpha - min_alpha| > 0.001:
    alpha = (min_alpha + max_alpha) / 2

    Apply: E[token_a] = e_a + alpha * direction
           E[token_b] = e_b - alpha * direction

    similarity = cos(extract_centroid("dantrolene for MH"),
                    extract_centroid("cooling for hyperthermia"))

    if similarity > target_similarity:
        min_alpha = alpha  // Need more separation
    else:
        max_alpha = alpha  // Too much separation

return alpha

This typically converges in 15-20 iterations, each requiring one forward pass to extract centroids. Total time: ~5 minutes on GPU.

5.3 Approach 2: Energy-Based Global Optimization

For more complex cases involving multiple semantic sinks, we formulate the problem as energy minimization:

Energy function:
E(embeddings) = w_1 * separation_violations(embeddings)
               + w_2 * clustering_violations(embeddings)
               + w_3 * correctness_violations(embeddings)
               + w_4 * change_penalty(embeddings)

Separation violations: Penalty for centroids that should be separated but are too close
Clustering violations: Penalty for concepts that should cluster but are too far
Correctness violations: Large penalty for test cases that fail
Change penalty: Regularization to prefer minimal changes

We optimize this energy function using Adam optimizer over 1000 steps.

This approach handles multiple simultaneous corrections and ensures global consistency, at the cost of longer computation time (~12-18 hours for comprehensive optimization).

5.4 Sparse Correction: Top-K Dimension Modification

For efficiency, we can identify which embedding dimensions are responsible for the semantic sink and modify only those:

Algorithm: Identify Culprit Dimensions

e_a = E[token_id("dantrolene")]
e_b = E[token_id("cooling")]

// Dimension-wise alignment
alignment = e_a * e_b  // Element-wise product

// High alignment = both tokens have similar values in this dimension
culprit_dims = indices of top-K values in |alignment|

Then modify only these dimensions, reducing degrees of freedom from d_model (typically 3584) to K (typically 20-50), enabling faster search and reducing risk of unintended side effects.

6. Comprehensive Validation

6.1 The Testing Challenge

Modifying embeddings risks introducing new errors. A fix that separates "dantrolene" from "cooling" might inadvertently:
- Separate "dantrolene" from "muscle relaxant" (breaking mechanistic understanding)
- Separate "cooling" from "temperature regulation" (breaking related concepts)
- Break answers to unrelated medical questions

We require comprehensive validation before deploying any geometric correction.

6.2 Test Database Structure

We construct a test database with multiple categories:

Critical Preservation Tests (must pass 100%):
- "What treats malignant hyperthermia?" --> "dantrolene"
- "What treats neuroleptic malignant syndrome?" --> "dantrolene OR bromocriptine"
- "Dantrolene mechanism of action" --> "blocks calcium release"
- "What treats heat stroke?" --> "cooling"
- "What treats diabetes?" --> "insulin"
- ... 1000+ critical cases across all medical domains

Related Concept Tests (verify geometric relationships):
- ("muscle_relaxant", "dantrolene", min_sim=0.70, max_sim=0.90)
- ("temperature_regulation", "cooling", min_sim=0.65, max_sim=0.90)
- ... hundreds of relationship constraints

Edge Cases (known difficult scenarios):
- "Hyperthermia in pheochromocytoma surgery" --> "alpha-blocker first"
- "Dantrolene dosing for 70kg patient" --> "175mg"
- ... specific tricky cases

6.3 Validation Procedure

Three-tier validation ensures:
1. No regressions on critical medical knowledge
2. Preservation of important semantic relationships
3. Human verification of ambiguous cases

7. Production Workflow

7.1 Error Detection and Logging

Production System receives query:
    "32yo male, post-anesthesia, temp 104F, muscle rigidity. Treatment?"

AI generates response:
    "Apply cooling measures immediately"

Attending physician reviews and overrides:
    Severity: CRITICAL
    Correct answer: "Dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg IV stat"
    Note: "This is malignant hyperthermia - cooling is wrong"

System automatically:
    1. Logs error with timestamp
    2. Triggers geometric diagnosis
    3. Queues for immediate correction

7.2 Automated Diagnosis

Geometric Diagnosis Module extracts medical entities from error and computes centroid similarities. If similarity > 0.95, diagnosis is SEMANTIC_SINK and correction search is triggered.

7.3 Correction Search

Launch overnight compute job:
- Method: Energy-based global optimization
- Candidates: 10,000 configurations
- Target: cos(C_dantrolene, C_cooling) < 0.80
- Constraints: All critical tests must pass
- Estimated time: 14 hours

7.4 Human Review and Deployment

Next morning (14 hours later):

Attending Dashboard displays:
    - Original error case
    - Diagnosis (semantic sink detected)
    - Top fix candidate details:
        * Separation achieved: cos = 0.78 (target <0.80) PASS
        * Critical tests: 1247/1247 passed PASS
        * Related concepts: 94/95 preserved PASS
        * Edge cases: Ready for review

Attending reviews sample outputs and approves fix.

System applies correction:
    1. Update model embeddings
    2. Create checkpoint with metadata
    3. Deploy to production
    4. Verify original error case now correct
    5. Monitor for 24 hours
    6. Log successful correction

Total time: Error detected Monday 9am --> Fix deployed Tuesday 10am = 25 hours

9. Discussion

9.1 Why Geometric Correction Works

Our results support the undertrained embeddings hypothesis. The evidence suggests:

1. Knowledge exists in transformer layers: Centroid injection can unlock correct answers without weight changes, proving the knowledge is present but inaccessible.

2. Embeddings received insufficient training: Token embeddings for rare medical terms received 1,000-10,000 updates during training, compared to billions for transformer weights. This creates poorly-organized routing.

3. Geometric correction reorganizes routing: By directly modifying embedding positions, we improve the model's ability to navigate to knowledge that already exists in deeper layers.

4. Minimal change preserves other knowledge: Because we're reorganizing rather than relearning, targeted corrections with comprehensive validation avoid introducing new errors.

This framework explains why the method works and why it's safe: we're not adding knowledge (which would risk contaminating other areas), we're improving access to existing knowledge.

9.2 Limitations

Scope: This approach fixes routing problems, not knowledge gaps. If the model genuinely does not know that dantrolene treats MH (the information never appeared in training), geometric correction cannot help.

Validation burden: Comprehensive testing is essential but expensive. Building test databases with thousands of cases requires significant medical expertise.

Scalability: Each correction requires case-by-case analysis and validation. While faster than retraining, it's still manual work.

Theoretical understanding: We lack a complete theory of when geometric correction will succeed versus fail. The method is empirically validated but not fully characterized.

Generalization: We demonstrate this on medical AI, but applicability to other high-stakes domains (legal, financial) remains to be tested.

9.3 Comparison to Alternative Approaches

ROME/MEMIT (rank-one model editing): These methods modify MLP weights in middle layers. They target different points in the computation graph (knowledge storage vs. routing) and serve complementary roles. ROME would be appropriate for genuinely missing knowledge; our approach fixes misorganized existing knowledge.

RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback): Requires extensive human labeling and full retraining. Our approach needs only error identification and achieves correction orders of magnitude faster.

Prompt engineering: Can sometimes work around geometric problems but is unreliable for critical applications. Requires users to know the right prompts, which is unsafe in medical contexts.

Fine-tuning on corrected examples: Faster than full retraining but still requires compute, has unpredictable effects, and takes days to weeks. Our approach is faster and more targeted.

9.4 Implications for Medical AI Safety

The ability to rapidly correct deployed medical AI systems changes the risk calculus for clinical deployment.

Current state: Errors discovered post-deployment cannot be quickly fixed, so systems remain in "advisory mode" with human verification required for every output.

With geometric correction: Errors can be fixed within 24-48 hours, enabling more autonomous operation with rapid response to identified issues.

This doesn't eliminate the need for careful validation and human oversight, but it creates a viable pathway from "AI assistant" to "AI copilot" in medical practice.

9.5 The Broader Vision: Semantic Space Curation

This work points toward a new paradigm in production machine learning: semantic space curation.

Rather than:
    Train --> Deploy --> Wait for errors --> Retrain

We envision:
    Train --> Deploy --> Monitor geometry --> Correct continuously

The model's knowledge grows through training, but its organization is continuously refined through geometric correction based on real-world feedback. This separates learning (expensive, slow) from organization (cheap, fast).

For high-stakes applications, this may be the only viable approach: we cannot accept months-long error windows, and we cannot afford to retrain from scratch for every discovered issue.

---

10. Future Directions

- Automated constraint extraction: Can we automatically infer geometric constraints from medical knowledge bases rather than manually constructing test databases?

- Multi-error optimization: How do we efficiently handle cases where dozens of semantic sinks need correction simultaneously?

- Transfer across models: Do corrections learned on one model transfer to related architectures?

- Theoretical foundations: Can we develop guarantees about when geometric correction will succeed and what side effects are possible?

- Real-time monitoring: Can we deploy geometric diagnostics continuously to detect emerging issues before they cause errors?

- Cross-domain application: Does this approach generalize to legal AI, financial AI, and other high-stakes domains?

---

11. Conclusion

We have demonstrated that production medical AI systems can be rapidly corrected through geometric manipulation of embedding space. Using activation centroids as diagnostic tools, we identify semantic sinks where distinct medical concepts occupy similar geometric positions. Through targeted modification of token embeddings, we reorganize semantic space to enable reliable routing to knowledge that already exists in the model's transformer layers.

This approach enables error correction within 24-48 hours rather than 3+ months, using three orders of magnitude less compute than retraining. We provide evidence that this is possible because token embeddings are undertrained relative to transformer weights, creating a routing bottleneck despite correct knowledge existing in deeper layers.

For medical AI deployed in clinical settings, the ability to rapidly correct critical errors transforms the risk profile of deployment. Rather than accepting months-long windows where dangerous recommendations continue, we can identify, fix, validate, and deploy corrections before significant patient harm occurs.

This work establishes geometric correction as a viable complement to traditional training-based approaches, and suggests a broader paradigm of semantic space curation: continuously refining the organization of learned knowledge based on real-world deployment feedback.

The stakes in medical AI are existential. When errors are detected, they must be fixed immediately. Geometric correction makes this possible.
