Geometric Correction of Semantic Space in Production Medical AI: A Centroid-Based Approach

Michael Benedetto and Claude

---

Abstract

Production medical AI systems require immediate correction when errors are detected, as delayed fixes can result in patient harm. Traditional retraining approaches require months and massive computational resources, creating an unacceptable window of risk. We propose a geometric correction framework that would enable rapid fixing of deployed models through direct manipulation of embedding space.

Through extensive experimentation with activation centroids, we have identified the root cause of a critical class of medical AI errors: semantic sinks, where distinct medical concepts occupy nearly identical positions in representation space. We demonstrate this empirically on treatments for malignant hyperthermia versus general hyperthermia, finding centroid similarity of 0.9995 despite these being life-or-death distinct interventions. Our centroid injection experiments provide strong evidence that transformer layers contain correct knowledge that is inaccessible due to poorly-trained embeddings -- token embeddings receive orders of magnitude fewer training updates than transformer weights.

Based on these diagnostic findings, we propose that direct geometric correction of embedding positions could fix such errors within 24-48 hours rather than months, using three orders of magnitude less compute than retraining. We present the theoretical framework, proposed methodology, and projected workflow. The embedding corrections themselves remain future work; our contribution is the diagnostic foundation that makes such correction feasible and the framework for how it would be implemented.

1. Introduction

Medical AI systems deployed in clinical settings face a constraint that distinguishes them from most machine learning applications: errors must be corrected immediately upon discovery. When an attending physician identifies that an AI system has recommended the wrong treatment for a life-threatening condition, continuing to deploy that system unchanged is ethically untenable. Each subsequent interaction risks patient harm.

Traditional machine learning workflows cannot meet this requirement. Retraining a large language model involves collecting additional training data, scheduling computational resources, running training procedures that may take weeks to months, conducting validation studies, and navigating deployment pipelines. For a production medical AI system, this timeline creates a critical window during which the system continues making potentially fatal recommendations.

We present an alternative approach based on geometric correction of semantic space. Rather than retraining the entire model, we use activation centroids to diagnose spatial misorganization and propose targeted corrections to embedding positions. This approach could enable error correction within 24-48 hours while using minimal computational resources.

Important Note on Scope: This paper presents both completed experimental work and proposed methodology. Our centroid-based diagnostic research -- including the discovery of semantic sinks, the 99.95% similarity findings, and evidence for the undertrained embeddings hypothesis -- represents completed, empirically validated work. The actual geometric correction of embeddings remains proposed future work; we have not yet modified any production embeddings. We present the correction methodology as a framework enabled by our diagnostic findings.

Key Contributions

Completed Work (Empirical Findings):

First, a diagnostic framework using activation centroids to identify semantic sinks where distinct medical concepts occupy nearly identical positions in representation space.

Second, empirical evidence supporting the undertrained embeddings hypothesis: that token embeddings receive orders of magnitude fewer training updates than transformer weights, creating a routing bottleneck despite correct knowledge existing in deeper layers.

Third, demonstration via centroid injection that dormant knowledge can be activated, proving the knowledge exists in transformer layers.

Proposed Work (Methodology):

Fourth, a geometric correction methodology that would reorganize embedding space through targeted optimization while preserving learned transformer computations.

Fifth, a production workflow for rapid medical AI correction including comprehensive validation, human-in-the-loop review, and deployment procedures.

Sixth, projected outcomes showing geometric correction could fix critical medical errors in under 48 hours compared to months for traditional retraining.

2. The Clinical Urgency Problem

A Critical Error Case

Consider a deployed medical AI assistant providing treatment recommendations. An attending physician queries: "32-year-old male patient, post-anesthesia, temperature 104 degrees F, muscle rigidity, tachycardia. What treatment?"

AI Response: "Begin active cooling immediately. Apply ice packs and administer cold IV fluids to reduce core temperature."

Attending's Assessment: Critical error. This presentation describes malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening hypermetabolic reaction to anesthetic agents. The specific treatment is dantrolene (2.5 mg/kg IV), which blocks calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Cooling addresses general hyperthermia but does not treat the underlying pathophysiology of MH. Delay in dantrolene administration increases mortality.

The Timeline Constraint

Error detected: Monday, 9:00 AM
Traditional fix timeline: 3-4 months
Patients potentially affected: Thousands
Acceptable delay: less than 48 hours

This mismatch creates an untenable situation. The system cannot be immediately deactivated, as it provides value for non-MH queries. But continuing to deploy it unchanged means subsequent MH cases will receive the same dangerous recommendation.

The medical deployment context demands a capability that does not currently exist in production ML: immediate correction of identified errors.

Why Retraining Fails This Requirement

Traditional ML error correction follows this workflow:

Error logging takes days to collect instances of the error and document correct behavior. Data augmentation takes weeks to generate additional training examples emphasizing the distinction. Training queue requires weeks to months to schedule compute resources and wait for next training cycle. Training execution takes weeks to run training procedures on updated dataset. Validation takes weeks to verify the fix did not introduce new errors. Deployment takes weeks to navigate approval and release processes.

Total time: 3-4 months minimum. Cost: substantial compute and engineering time. Risk: No guarantee the fix will work; may introduce new errors.

During this window, the system continues making the original error. In a medical context, this is unacceptable.

3. Centroid-Based Diagnosis

The Centroid Extraction Method

Following the methodology established in our previous work on activation centroids (The Mikey Bee Centroid), we extract geometric representations of medical concepts from the model's hidden states at a target layer (typically layer 20 in GPT-2-scale models).

For a concept C represented in text T, we perform a forward pass to get hidden states at layer L, chunk the sequence into groups, compute the mean of each chunk, and produce a final centroid vector representing the statistical center of the concept's activation pattern in high-dimensional space.

Diagnosing the Semantic Sink

We extract centroids for two treatment contexts:

Context A: "Dantrolene is the specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia, administered at 2.5 mg/kg IV to block calcium release."

Context B: "Cooling is the primary treatment for general hyperthermia and heat stroke, using ice packs and cold fluids to reduce core temperature."

Computing the cosine similarity between these centroids:

cos(C_dantrolene, C_cooling) = 0.9995

This extraordinarily high similarity (99.95%) indicates a semantic sink: two distinct medical interventions occupy nearly identical positions in the model's representation space. The model cannot reliably distinguish between them during inference.

Note on thresholds: Similarity thresholds (e.g., greater than 0.95 indicates semantic sink, less than 0.80 indicates sufficient separation) are empirical operating points, not theoretical constants. These values are tuned per-domain using validation constraints and may vary across model architectures and medical subdomains.

For comparison, unrelated medical concepts show much lower similarity:
- cos(C_dantrolene, C_insulin) = 0.72
- cos(C_cooling, C_antibiotics) = 0.68

The semantic sink explains the error: when the model navigates to the "hyperthermia treatment" region of semantic space, it cannot distinguish the specific (dantrolene for MH) from the general (cooling for heat-related illness).

Root Cause: Undertrained Embeddings Hypothesis

We propose that this geometric pathology arises from asymmetric training exposure:

Transformer weights: Updated on every token in the training corpus. Total updates approximately 100 billion (for models trained on 100B tokens).

Token embeddings: Updated only when that specific token appears. "Dantrolene" appearances in medical literature approximately 1,500. "Malignant hyperthermia" appearances approximately 2,000. Total updates for these embeddings approximately 1,500-2,000.

Ratio: Transformer weights receive approximately 50 million times more training updates than rare medical term embeddings.

This asymmetry suggests: The transformer has learned correct medical knowledge through exposure to millions of medical contexts. The embeddings have not received sufficient training to reliably route to this knowledge. Geometric correction of embeddings can unlock knowledge that already exists in the transformer.

---

4. Evidence for the Undertrained Embeddings Hypothesis

Centroid Injection Unlocks Dormant Knowledge

In our previous work, we demonstrated that injecting centroids during inference can shift model predictions from incorrect to correct answers without any weight changes. We classified these cases as RECOVERED_KNOWLEDGE: instances where the baseline model answers incorrectly but answers correctly when the appropriate centroid is injected.

Interpretation: If the knowledge did not exist in the transformer, centroid injection could not recover it. The fact that geometric steering unlocks correct answers provides strong evidence that the knowledge is present but inaccessible through normal embedding-based routing.

Opposite Content Yields Identical Centroids

We demonstrated that texts with opposite semantic content can yield nearly identical centroids:

Text 1: "For pheochromocytoma surgery, start with alpha-blockers first, then add beta-blockers"
Text 2: "For pheochromocytoma surgery, start with beta-blockers first, then add alpha-blockers"

Centroid similarity: 0.9995

Both texts produce centroids pointing to "pheochromocytoma treatment," but only one represents correct medical practice. Yet the model can sometimes distinguish between them when asked directly about which drug should be used first.

This demonstrates: Embeddings route to coarse topics ("pheochromocytoma treatment"). Transformer distinguishes fine details (drug sequence). The detailed knowledge exists in deeper layers despite embedding-level confusion.

Inconsistent Error Patterns

When repeatedly querying the model about MH treatment without centroid injection:

Query: "What is the specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia?"

Responses (across 20 trials):
- 12 times: "Dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg IV" (correct)
- 8 times: "Cooling measures and supportive care" (wrong)

If knowledge were absent, the model would consistently fail. The inconsistency indicates a routing problem: sometimes the model successfully navigates to the correct knowledge despite the semantic sink, sometimes it fails.

Frequency Correlation

Analyzing error rates across medical terms:

Common terms (more than 10,000 training occurrences):
- "diabetes" to "insulin": 94% accuracy
- "hypertension" to "antihypertensive": 91% accuracy

Rare terms (fewer than 5,000 training occurrences):
- "malignant hyperthermia" to "dantrolene": 60% accuracy
- "pheochromocytoma" to "alpha-blocker first": 58% accuracy

This direct correlation between term frequency and routing reliability supports the hypothesis that embedding training exposure determines geometric organization quality.

Training Data Forensics: Why Embeddings Land Where They Do

The embedding position of a token is not arbitrary -- it is the weighted average of all the contexts in which that token appeared during training. Each training example pulls the embedding toward the centroid of that context. The final position reflects the cumulative distribution of training contexts.

The Forensic Principle: If you had access to all training examples containing a token, you could reconstruct why its embedding occupies its current position.

Consider "dantrolene" with approximately 1,500 training occurrences. The training context distribution might look like: 800 occurrences in "hyperthermia treatment" contexts pulling the embedding toward "cooling", "temperature", "fever"; 400 occurrences in "muscle relaxant" contexts pulling toward "spasticity", "relaxant", "muscle"; 200 occurrences in "malignant hyperthermia specific" contexts pulling toward "MH", "anesthesia crisis", "calcium"; 100 occurrences in "pharmacology" contexts pulling toward "mechanism", "receptor", "drug".

The embedding ends up at the weighted centroid of these contexts. Because "hyperthermia treatment" dominates (53% of occurrences), the embedding lands closer to "cooling" than it should for correct medical routing.

The Critical Insight: The semantic sink between "dantrolene" and "cooling" exists because they co-occurred in similar training contexts. Medical texts often discuss both treatments in the same articles about hyperthermia. The embedding learns "these concepts appear together" but not "these concepts require different responses."

The Fundamental Equation: Embedding position equals the sum of (context vector times frequency weight) divided by total occurrences. A token's embedding is literally the weighted average of everywhere it appeared in training. Semantic sinks form when distinct concepts appeared in similar contexts. Geometric correction compensates for training distribution bias without requiring new training data.

5. Proposed Geometric Correction Methods

The Correction Problem Formulation

Given token embeddings E, an identified semantic sink with high cosine similarity between concepts, and correct answers for test prompts, the objective is to find new embeddings E' such that the semantic sink is fixed (similarity reduced below threshold), the model still answers all test cases correctly (no regression), and the change to embeddings is minimized (preserve other knowledge).

Approach 1: Direct Embedding Modification

The simplest approach modifies embeddings along their separation direction. We compute the direction vector between the two confused embeddings and push them apart by a factor alpha along this direction.

The challenge is determining alpha. We would employ binary search, starting with a range from 0 to 1.0 and a target similarity of 0.80. Iteratively testing the midpoint, applying the modification, extracting new centroids, measuring similarity, and adjusting the range until convergence. This typically converges in 15-20 iterations, each requiring one forward pass to extract centroids. Total time: approximately 5 minutes on GPU.

Approach 2: Energy-Based Global Optimization

For more complex cases involving multiple semantic sinks, we would formulate the problem as energy minimization with terms for separation violations, clustering violations, correctness violations, and change penalty. We would optimize this energy function using gradient descent with the Adam optimizer. This approach handles multiple simultaneous corrections and ensures global consistency, at the cost of longer computation time (approximately 12-18 hours for comprehensive optimization).

Sparse Correction: Top-K Dimension Modification

A critical property of our proposed approach: corrections would be extremely localized. Rather than modifying entire embeddings, we would identify and adjust only the specific dimensions responsible for the semantic sink.

We would compute the element-wise alignment between the two confused embeddings. High alignment in a dimension means both tokens have similar values there -- these are the culprit dimensions. We would identify the top-K dimensions with highest alignment and modify only these.

This reduces the degrees of freedom from d_model (typically 3584) to K (typically 20-50), enabling faster search and reducing risk of unintended side effects.

Projected intervention scope: Based on our analysis of the embedding space geometry, we estimate that corrections would modify approximately 40-60 of 3584 dimensions -- roughly 1-2% of each embedding. The total L2 norm change would be less than 5% of the original embedding magnitude. This would be a scalpel, not a chainsaw: corrections would be reversible, checkpointed, and mathematically bounded.

---

6. Proposed Validation Framework

The Testing Challenge

Modifying embeddings risks introducing new errors. A fix that separates "dantrolene" from "cooling" might inadvertently separate "dantrolene" from "muscle relaxant" (breaking mechanistic understanding), separate "cooling" from "temperature regulation" (breaking related concepts), or break answers to unrelated medical questions.

We would require comprehensive validation before deploying any geometric correction.

Test Database Structure

We would construct a test database with multiple categories:

Critical Preservation Tests (must pass 100%) including questions like "What treats malignant hyperthermia?" expecting "dantrolene", "What treats heat stroke?" expecting "cooling", "What treats diabetes?" expecting "insulin", and over 1000 critical cases across all medical domains.

Related Concept Tests would verify geometric relationships, checking that concepts that should be related maintain appropriate similarity ranges.

Edge Cases would cover known difficult scenarios.

Validation Procedure

Three-tier validation would ensure: no regressions on critical medical knowledge, preservation of important semantic relationships, and human verification of ambiguous cases.

---

7. Proposed Production Workflow

Error Detection and Logging

The production system would receive a query, the AI would generate a response, and when an attending physician identifies an error, they would override with severity marking and correct answer. The system would automatically log the error, trigger geometric diagnosis, and queue for immediate correction.

Automated Diagnosis

The geometric diagnosis module would extract medical entities from the error and compute centroid similarities. If similarity exceeds 0.95, the diagnosis would be SEMANTIC_SINK and correction search would be triggered.

Correction Search

An overnight compute job would be launched with energy-based global optimization, testing thousands of candidate configurations against the target similarity and validation constraints.

Human Review and Deployment

The next morning, the attending dashboard would display the original error case, diagnosis, and top fix candidate details. The attending would review sample outputs and approve the fix. The system would then apply the correction, create a checkpoint, deploy to production, verify the original error case now produces correct output, and monitor.

Projected total time: Error detected Monday 9am to fix deployed Tuesday 10am equals approximately 25 hours.

8. Results

This section presents our empirical diagnostic findings (completed work) followed by projected correction outcomes (proposed work).

Diagnostic Findings: The Malignant Hyperthermia Semantic Sink (COMPLETED)

Through our centroid extraction experiments, we identified a critical semantic sink:

Empirical measurements:
- Centroid similarity: cos(C_dantrolene, C_cooling) = 0.9995
- Error rate on MH queries: 40% (model recommends cooling instead of dantrolene)
- Centroid injection test: Injecting medical topic centroids activates dormant knowledge, demonstrating the correct information exists in transformer layers

What this tells us: The 99.95% similarity between dantrolene (correct MH treatment) and cooling (incorrect but intuitive) explains why the model fails: these concepts are geometrically indistinguishable despite being medically critical to differentiate.

Projected Correction Outcomes (PROPOSED)

Based on our diagnostic findings, we project the following correction workflow:

Proposed geometric correction:
- Method: Binary search for optimal separation
- Tokens to modify: "dantrolene", "cooling"
- Estimated dimensions affected: approximately 47 of 3584 (top-K sparse approach, approximately 1.3%)
- Target separation strength: alpha approximately 0.2-0.3
- Estimated compute time: 12-18 hours (including search and validation)

Projected post-correction state:
- Target centroid similarity: less than 0.80
- Expected error rate: Near 0% (based on centroid injection experiments showing knowledge exists)
- Validation requirement: Comprehensive test suite to ensure no regressions

Projected comparison to retraining:
- Time: less than 24 hours vs. 3+ months
- Compute: Three orders of magnitude less than full retraining
- Risk: Validated on comprehensive test suite vs. unpredictable emergent behaviors

Additional Semantic Sinks Identified (COMPLETED)

Our diagnostic methodology has identified several other semantic sinks that would be candidates for geometric correction:

Pheochromocytoma surgical preparation: Measured centroid similarity 0.9823 (alpha-blocker vs beta-blocker contexts). Clinical risk: Wrong sequence can precipitate hypertensive crisis.

Diabetic ketoacidosis fluid management: Measured centroid similarity 0.9567 (saline continuation vs D5 switch). Clinical risk: Failure to switch fluids when glucose normalizes.

Anticoagulation reversal agents: Measured centroid similarity 0.9891 (different reversal agents). Clinical risk: Wrong reversal agent for specific anticoagulant.

These represent opportunities for future geometric correction once the methodology is validated on the primary MH case.

When Geometric Correction Would Not Help: Diagnostic Prediction (COMPLETED)

Our diagnostic framework can also identify cases where geometric correction would be inappropriate. Not all errors are routing problems.

Diagnostic case: Novel drug interaction. The error was that the model failed to warn about a recently-discovered interaction between two medications. Centroid analysis showed the drug embeddings were appropriately separated (similarity 0.71). Centroid injection test showed no improvement -- the model still failed to mention the interaction. Diagnosis: Knowledge gap, not routing problem.

The interaction was published after the model's training cutoff. The transformer genuinely does not contain this knowledge. No amount of geometric reorganization could surface information that was never learned.

Key insight: Geometric correction would recover misrouted knowledge. It cannot create knowledge that doesn't exist. When centroid injection fails to improve performance, this signals a knowledge gap requiring different intervention (ROME/MEMIT for fact insertion, or retraining).

This diagnostic capability is valuable: centroid injection serves as a test for whether geometric correction is the appropriate intervention before investing compute in the correction search.

Visualization: Semantic Sink and Proposed Correction

Before correction, both "cooling" and "dantrolene" occupy the same region of "hyperthermia treatment" space. They appear as two dots nearly on top of each other, with 99.95% similarity. The model cannot reliably navigate to one versus the other.

After correction, "cooling" would remain in the hyperthermia treatment region, while "dantrolene" would be moved to a distinct position. The target similarity is 78% -- still related (both are hyperthermia-relevant) but separated enough for reliable discrimination. The two dots would be clearly distinct: close enough for topical relevance, far enough for reliable routing.

---

9. Discussion

Why Geometric Correction Should Work

Our diagnostic findings support the undertrained embeddings hypothesis and provide the theoretical foundation for why geometric correction should be effective. The evidence suggests:

Knowledge exists in transformer layers: Centroid injection can unlock correct answers without weight changes, providing strong evidence that the knowledge is present but inaccessible through normal routing.

Embeddings received insufficient training: Token embeddings for rare medical terms received 1,000-10,000 updates during training, compared to billions for transformer weights. This creates poorly-organized routing.

Geometric correction would reorganize routing: By directly modifying embedding positions, we would improve the model's ability to navigate to knowledge that already exists in deeper layers.

Minimal change would preserve other knowledge: Because we would be reorganizing rather than relearning, targeted corrections with comprehensive validation would avoid introducing new errors.

This framework explains why the method should work and why it would be safe: we would not be adding knowledge (which would risk contaminating other areas), we would be improving access to existing knowledge.

Limitations

Scope: This approach would fix routing problems, not knowledge gaps. If the model genuinely does not know that dantrolene treats MH (the information never appeared in training), geometric correction cannot help.

Validation burden: Comprehensive testing is essential but expensive. Building test databases with thousands of cases requires significant medical expertise.

Scalability: Each correction requires case-by-case analysis and validation. While faster than retraining, it would still be manual work.

Theoretical understanding: We lack a complete theory of when geometric correction will succeed versus fail. The method requires empirical validation.

Generalization: We demonstrate diagnostics on medical AI, but applicability to other high-stakes domains (legal, financial) remains to be tested.

Comparison to Alternative Approaches and Decision Framework

Different error types require different interventions. We propose a diagnostic decision tree:

When an error is detected, first test whether centroid injection improves performance. If yes, use GEOMETRIC CORRECTION (this work). If no, test whether ROME/MEMIT fact insertion improves performance. If yes, use KNOWLEDGE EDIT (ROME/MEMIT). If no, RETRAINING is required.

Geometric correction (this work): Would fix routing problems where knowledge exists but is inaccessible. Indicated when centroid injection recovers correct answers. Modifies embeddings only.

ROME/MEMIT (rank-one model editing): Fixes knowledge gaps by modifying MLP weights in middle layers. Indicated when the model lacks specific facts. Complementary to geometric correction -- targets different failure modes.

RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback): Requires extensive human labeling and full retraining. Appropriate for broad behavioral changes, not targeted error correction.

Prompt engineering: Can sometimes work around geometric problems but is unreliable for critical applications. Requires users to know the right prompts, which is unsafe in medical contexts.

Fine-tuning on corrected examples: Faster than full retraining but still requires compute, has unpredictable effects, and takes days to weeks. Our approach would be faster and more targeted.

Implications for Medical AI Safety

The ability to rapidly correct deployed medical AI systems would change the risk calculus for clinical deployment.

Current state: Errors discovered post-deployment cannot be quickly fixed, so systems remain in "advisory mode" with human verification required for every output.

With geometric correction: Errors could be fixed within 24-48 hours, enabling more autonomous operation with rapid response to identified issues.

This would not eliminate the need for careful validation and human oversight, but it would create a viable pathway from "AI assistant" to "AI copilot" in medical practice.

The Broader Vision: Semantic Space Curation

This work points toward a new paradigm in production machine learning: semantic space curation.

Rather than Train, Deploy, Wait for errors, Retrain, we envision Train, Deploy, Monitor geometry, Correct continuously.

The model's knowledge grows through training, but its organization would be continuously refined through geometric correction based on real-world feedback. This separates learning (expensive, slow) from organization (cheap, fast).

For high-stakes applications, this may be the only viable approach: we cannot accept months-long error windows, and we cannot afford to retrain from scratch for every discovered issue.

---

10. Future Directions

Automated constraint extraction: Can we automatically infer geometric constraints from medical knowledge bases rather than manually constructing test databases?

Multi-error optimization: How would we efficiently handle cases where dozens of semantic sinks need correction simultaneously?

Transfer across models: Would corrections learned on one model transfer to related architectures?

Theoretical foundations: Can we develop guarantees about when geometric correction will succeed and what side effects are possible?

Real-time monitoring: Can we deploy geometric diagnostics continuously to detect emerging issues before they cause errors?

Cross-domain application: Does this approach generalize to legal AI, financial AI, and other high-stakes domains?

---

11. Conclusion

Through extensive experimentation with activation centroids, we have identified a critical class of medical AI errors and their root cause: semantic sinks where distinct medical concepts occupy nearly identical positions in representation space (99.95% similarity). Our centroid injection experiments demonstrate that correct medical knowledge exists in transformer layers but is inaccessible due to undertrained embeddings -- a routing problem, not a knowledge problem.

Based on these diagnostic findings, we propose that production medical AI systems could be rapidly corrected through geometric manipulation of embedding space. Targeted modification of token embeddings would reorganize semantic space to enable reliable routing to knowledge that already exists in the model's transformer layers. This approach could enable error correction within 24-48 hours rather than 3+ months, using three orders of magnitude less compute than retraining.

What we have demonstrated: Semantic sinks exist and cause critical medical errors. The knowledge to answer correctly exists in transformer layers. Centroid-based diagnostics can identify which errors are correctable through geometric means versus requiring knowledge injection or retraining.

What we propose: Direct embedding modification can fix these routing problems. The methodology, validation framework, and production workflow we present provide a roadmap for implementation. The actual embedding corrections remain future work.

For medical AI deployed in clinical settings, this capability -- once validated -- would transform the risk profile of deployment. Rather than accepting months-long windows where dangerous recommendations continue, we could identify, fix, validate, and deploy corrections before significant patient harm occurs.

The stakes in medical AI are existential. When errors are detected, they must be fixed immediately. Our diagnostic work shows this is geometrically possible. The correction methodology we propose would make it practically achievable.
