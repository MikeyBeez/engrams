Envy is a common human emotion that arises when we perceive ourselves as lacking something that others have, whether it be material possessions, achievements, or recognition. It's important to remember that everyone has their own journey and timeline for success, and comparing yourself to others can be misleading and detrimental to your own progress.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to cope with feelings of envy and inadequacy:\n\n1. **Self-Reflection**: Understand why you are feeling this way. Are you comparing yourself to someone else because of their success, or is there another underlying issue? Recognizing the root cause can help you address it more effectively.\n\n2. **Focus on Your Goals**: Instead of dwelling on what others have achieved, focus on your own goals and aspirations. Set realistic targets for yourself and work towards them consistently.\n\n3. **Learn from Others**: Use the success of others as inspiration",
